    "motd": "Welcome to v5.0.0 of LunaSea!\n\nThank you to all the beta testers who helped squash a ton of bugs in this release, but let's jump straight into some of what's new:\n\nRadarr has been completely rewritten to have full support for v3.0.0+! Older releases are no longer compatible, but with this upgrade LunaSea now supports features such as manual import, individual movie history, queue management, tags, and so much more!\n\nThe user interface and experience has gotten a lot of major and minor tweaks. You'll find a whole new design for buttons, haptic vibrations, and scrolling back to the top of a list by tapping the AppBar just to name a few!\n\nLunaSea now also supports rich, deep-linking supported push notifications by adding webhooks into your modules for free! Head into the notifications section of the settings to get started.\n\nv5.0.0 includes tons of other changes, which can be found below:",
