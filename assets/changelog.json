    "motd": "This build introduces a new pseudo-module, the ability to add external modules! You can now add references to the web GUI for modules that are not supported by LunaSea to quickly and easily access their web GUIs from within LunaSea.\n\nThis build also introduces the first build for LunaSea to use precompiled SkSL shaders! LunaSea will no longer need to compile graphical shaders on-the-fly, and should have a noticeable performance boost especially on a cold start of LunaSea.",
