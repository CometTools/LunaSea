Please note that each new page load is an additional API hit, so please consider that when using indexers with limited API calls.\n\nBecause of the added support for infinite scrolling, there is no longer the option to sort or filter the fetched results, as these are not directly supported within the newznab specification. Client-sided sorting and filtering are not compatible with the concept of infinite scroll, so now releases will be shown in the indexer's returned positioning.",
