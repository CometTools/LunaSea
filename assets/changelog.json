    "motd": "This build introduces a revamped logging system. While most changes are not user-facing, the logs are now much more versatile and carry more information within the stack traces, which will allow for easier and better debugging of errors.\n\nThis build also introduces Firebase Analytics, which is being used with Firebase Crashlytics to give breadcrumb tracking for crashes. Breadcrumbs let me know how you got to the point of a crash, and do not contain any identifying information. Just as you can disable Firebase Crashlytics, a new option has been added to completely disable Firebase Analytics.\n\nIf you have previously disabled Firebase Crashlytics, you may need to disable Firebase Crashlytics in the settings again.",
